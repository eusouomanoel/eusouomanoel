Hi, I'm Manoel Neto, an Electrical Engineer and MBA in Business Management. 
I have a great ability to learn new things, solve problems and create solutions. Currently, I am expanding my skills by diving into web development, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and more. 
I am passionate about open-source projects and am eager to collaborate and learn from others in the community. My goal is to gain valuable experience and land my first job as a developer with passion for bringing ideas to life with code.
I've got experience in both front-end and back-end development and I'm always eager to learn more. My background in business management helps me approach projects with a strategic mindset.
